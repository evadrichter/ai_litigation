In the Order on Motions to Dismiss and Strike filed on October 30, 2023, the court limited the lawsuit in a number of significant ways. First, the court made clear that the copyright actions depend on registration of the plaintiffs' works; it dismissed the copyright actions of two of the three plaintiffs (McKernan and Ortiz) because they had not registered claims of copyright in any of their works, and it limited the copyright actions of plaintiff Andersen to the works in which she had registered claims of copyright. Second, the court was skeptical of plaintiffs' claims that the Stable Diffusion or Midjourney models could contain ""compressed copies"" of works owned by the plaintiffs, and it also suggested that the models could not be ""derivative"" of the plaintiffs' works in the copyright sense without being substantially similar to those works. Third, the court concluded that the complaint did not contain specific enough allegations that the defendants had removed copyright management information from the plaintiffs' works in violation of 17 USC 1202. Fourth, the court concluded that the complaint did not contain specific enough allegations about how the defendants violated the plaintiffs' right of publicity by using their names in advertising, or by allowing users of the text-to-image tools to use their names to generate images.  Fifth, the court held that the unfair competition claims were preempted by the Copyright Act insofar as they depended on copying, and otherwise were not supported by specific enough allegations of fraud. Sixth, the court held that the plaintiffs had not yet provided sufficient allegations that defendant DeviantArt breached its contract with the plaintiffs.

Although rental decisions have traditionally been made by housing providers, today many landlords contract with third-party tenant-screeners to make admission decisions for them.  This litigation seeks to ensure that CoreLogic and all tenant-screening companies who functionally make rental decisions on behalf of landlords make those decisions in accordance with fair housing requirements.This litigation seeks to ensure that CoreLogic and all tenant-screening companies follow fair housing requirements when they functionally make rental decisions on behalf of landlords, which adversely affected both Ms. Arroyo and the Connecticut Fair Housing Center and its mission of ensuring fair housing for the people of Connecticut.The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development observed in 2016 that excluding rental applicants because of their criminal records disproportionately harms Latinos and African Americans, who are significantly more likely than whites to be arrested or convicted.  Studies show such disparities are linked to differential enforcement rather than to differences in likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.  HUD advised that to avoid discriminating, an “individualized review” should be conducted considering the nature of the offense, how long ago it occurred, intervening changed circumstances, and other relevant factors to avoid denying housing to an applicant who does not pose a genuine and ongoing threat to persons or property.  Further, HUD’s guidance specifically advises landlords not to consider arrests that did not result in a conviction in making their evaluations.",,Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Second Circuit,2018,Active

Dark patterns can complicate or hide information, such as making it difficult for consumers to cancel a subscription service.As alleged in the complaint, TransUnion used an array of dark patterns to trick people into recurring payments and to make it difficult to cancel them. For example, under federal law, Americans are entitled to a free credit report from TransUnion through annualcreditreport.com. TransUnion asked consumers to provide credit card information that appeared to be part of an identity verification process. TransUnion then integrated deceptive buttons into the online interface that gave the impression that the consumer could also access a free credit score in addition to viewing their free credit report. In reality, clicking this button signed consumers up for recurring monthly charges using the credit card information they had provided.The only indication in the enrollment process that consumers were making some sort of purchase was through a fine print, low contrast disclosure, located off to the side of the enrollment form. The disclosure is inside an image that can take up to 30 seconds longer to load than the rest of the material in the form. This dark pattern triggered thousands of complaints.For consumers looking for a way out of their subscriptions, TransUnion not only failed to offer a simple mechanism for cancellation, it actively made it arduous for consumers to cancel through clever uses of font and color on its website.",,Order,2022,Inactive

Hirevue also moved to dismiss on severa substantive grounds. The court denied plaintiff's motion to dismiss on the ground that the Illinois law cannot be applied extraterritorially, because plaintiffs alleged that they accessed Hirevue's platform while they were located in Illinois, through use of a webcam. It denied a motion to dismiss on the ground that its conduct is governed only by Illinois's more recently enacted Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, holding that the two acts could be applied concurrently, and on the ground that Hirevue is an exempted ""financial institution"" because it contracts with at least one financial institution, holding that such an argument is too fact-specific to prevail in a 12(b)(6) motion.The court held that plaintiffs stated a claim under BIPA 15(a), because they plausibly alleged that Hirevue was ""in possession"" of biometric data; under 15(b), because they alleged that Hirevue ""captured and collected"" biometric data; and under 15(d), because they alleged that Hirevue ""disclosed, redisclosed, or otherwise disseminated"" biometric data.  However, the court held that plaintiff's complaint failed to state a claim under BIPA 15(c), which concerns ""sell[ing], leas[ing], trad[ing], or otherwise profit[ing]"" from biometric data.
